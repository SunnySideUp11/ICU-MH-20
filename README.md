# A Pilot Study of Deep Learning Models for Camera based Hand Hygiene Monitoring in ICU (EMBC 2023)

## Datasets

* We have collected a total of 20 video clips demonstrating hand hygiene from three different views of healthcare workers. All the videos have been stored in [Baidu Cloud](https://pan.baidu.com/s/1KlLKYKsHInm8ygD9huv6AA)(Extraction code: **e8bk**). 

The data structure would like:

```

    ├── image
    └── video
```
